* [A Visual Technique to Analyze Flow of Information in a Machine Learning System](https://ist.publisher.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/ist/ei/2018/00002018/00000001/art00013); Chaudhuri, Abon; Machine learning (ML) algorithms and machine learning based software systems implicitly or explicitly involve complex flow of information between various entities such as training data, feature space, validation set and results. Understanding the statistical distribution of such information and how they flow from one entity to another influence the operation and correctness of such systems, especially in large-scale applications that perform classification or prediction in real time. In this paper, we propose a visual approach to understand and analyze flow of information during model training and serving phases. We build the visualizations using a technique called Sankey Diagram - conventionally used to understand data flow among sets - to address various use cases of in a machine learning system. We demonstrate how the proposed technique, tweaked and twisted to suit a classification problem, can play a critical role in better understanding of the training data, the features, and the classifier performance. We also discuss how this technique enables diagnostic analysis of model predictions and comparative analysis of predictions from multiple classifiers.

* [A Step Towards Automatic Visual Analytics Pipeline Generation](https://ist.publisher.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/ist/ei/2018/00002018/00000001/art00010); Karer, Benjamin; Scheler, Inga; Hagen, Hans; Automatic generation of data visualizations allows to quickly deploy data visualizations. In visual analytics, the combination of automatic and human analysis increases the effort necessary to achieve similar effects substantially. Where automatic visualization only needs to map the data, in visual analytics the whole data preparation and processing pipeline has to be considered. The user is interested in representations reflecting certain interpretations of the data, for example the idea that different groups represent different clusters in the data. In this paper, we prove that an information-driven automatic design of visual analytics pipelines is feasible. To this end, we prove that the ability of an analysis system to derive and visualize data supporting inquired information is decidable – at least for real-world applications. Having overcome this major obstacle, we outline a general algorithm scheme that can be implemented on a wide range of data and information models.

* [BGS: A Large-Scale Graph Visualization Tool](https://ist.publisher.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/ist/ei/2018/00002018/00000001/art00011); Zhang, Fangyan; Zhang, Song; Lightsey, Christopher; Harun, Sarah; Wong, Pak Chung; We present BGS (Big Graph Surfer), a scalable graph visualization tool that creates hierarchical structure from original graphs and provide interactive navigation along the hierarchy by expanding or collapsing clusters when visualizing large-scale graphs. A distributed computing framework-Spark provides the backend for BGS on clustering and visualization. This architecture makes it capable of visualizing a graph bigger than 1 billion nodes or edges in real-time after preprocessing.

* [DQNViz: A Visual Analytics Approach to Understand Deep Q-Networks](http://edda-project.github.io/files/2018-08-13/dqnvis.pdf); Junpeng Wang, Liang Gou, Han-Wei Shen; Deep Q-Network (DQN), as one type of deep reinforcement learning model, targets to train an intelligent agent that acquires optimal actions while interacting with an environment. The model is well known for its ability to surpass professional human players across many Atari 2600 games. Despite the superhuman performance, in-depth understanding of the model and interpreting the sophisticated behaviors of the DQN agent remain to be challenging tasks, due to the long-time model training process and the large number of experiences dynamically generated by the agent. In this work, we propose DQNViz, a visual analytics system to expose details of the blind training process in four levels, and enable users to dive into the large experience space of the agent for comprehensive analysis.

* [iForest: Interpreting Random Forests via Visual Analytics](http://zhaoxun.me/publication/iForest.pdf); Xun Zhao, Yanhong Wu, Dik Lun Lee, and Weiwei Cui; As an ensemble model that consists of many independent decision trees, random forests generate predictions by feeding the input to internal trees and summarizing their outputs. The ensemble nature of the model helps random forests outperform any individual decision tree. However, it also leads to a poor model interpretability, which significantly hinders the model from being used in fields that require transparent and explainable predictions, such as medical diagnosis and financial fraud detection. T... To understand how a final prediction is achieved, it is desired to understand and compare all decision paths in the context of all tree structures, which is a huge challenge for any users. In this paper, we propose a visual analytic system aiming at interpreting random forest models and predictions. ... To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, two usage scenarios and a qualitative user study are conducted.

* [Manifold: A Model-Agnostic Framework for Interpretation and Diagnosis of Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00196); Jiawei Zhang, Yang Wang, Piero Molino, Lezhi Li, David S. Ebert; Interpretation and diagnosis of machine learning models have gained renewed interest in recent years with breakthroughs in new approaches. We present Manifold, a framework that utilizes visual analysis techniques to support interpretation, debugging, and comparison of machine learning models in a more transparent and interactive manner. Conventional techniques usually focus on visualizing the internal logic of a specific model type (i.e., deep neural networks), lacking the ability to extend to a more complex scenario where different model types are integrated. To this end, Manifold is designed as a generic framework that does not rely on or access the internal logic of the model and solely observes the input (i.e., instances or features) and the output (i.e., the predicted result and probability distribution). We describe the workflow of Manifold as an iterative process consisting of three major phases that are commonly involved in the model development and diagnosis process: inspection (hypothesis), explanation (reasoning), and refinement (verification).






* [DVQA: Understanding Data Visualizations via Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.08163.pdf); Kushal Kafle, Brian Price, Scott Cohen, Christopher Kanan; Bar charts are an effective way to convey numeric information, but today’s algorithms cannot parse them. Existing methods fail when faced with even minor variations in appearance. Here, we present DVQA, a dataset that tests many aspects of bar chart understanding in a question answering framework. Unlike visual question answering (VQA), DVQA requires processing words and answers that are unique to a particular bar chart.

* [DRX-VIS](https://sites.google.com/view/dxr-vis); DXR is a toolkit for rapidly prototyping Data visualizations in XR (augmented, mixed, and virtual reality). A visualization in DXR is a collection of Unity game objects whose properties  such as position, color, and size are mapped to data attributes. This mapping can be specified interactively at runtime via a graphical user interface (GUI) or via a high-level programming interface, inspired by Polestar and Vega-Lite, respectively. DXR is extensible, allowing the use of most Unity game objects for custom marks and channels. To learn more, check out the top navigation bar or the following links:
