* [A Visual Technique to Analyze Flow of Information in a Machine Learning System](https://ist.publisher.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/ist/ei/2018/00002018/00000001/art00013;jsessionid=1qv7cv3v936ri.x-ic-live-02#); Chaudhuri, Abon; Machine learning (ML) algorithms and machine learning based software systems implicitly or explicitly involve complex flow of information between various entities such as training data, feature space, validation set and results. Understanding the statistical distribution of such information and how they flow from one entity to another influence the operation and correctness of such systems, especially in large-scale applications that perform classification or prediction in real time. In this paper, we propose a visual approach to understand and analyze flow of information during model training and serving phases. We build the visualizations using a technique called Sankey Diagram - conventionally used to understand data flow among sets - to address various use cases of in a machine learning system. We demonstrate how the proposed technique, tweaked and twisted to suit a classification problem, can play a critical role in better understanding of the training data, the features, and the classifier performance. We also discuss how this technique enables diagnostic analysis of model predictions and comparative analysis of predictions from multiple classifiers.

Our goal is to investigate the bookmarking relationships within a single conference and interpret various conference relationships and trends via effective visualization, comparison, and recommendation.

* [A Step Towards Automatic Visual Analytics Pipeline Generation](https://ist.publisher.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/ist/ei/2018/00002018/00000001/art00010;jsessionid=1qv7cv3v936ri.x-ic-live-02#); Karer, Benjamin; Scheler, Inga; Hagen, Hans; Automatic generation of data visualizations allows to quickly deploy data visualizations. In visual analytics, the combination of automatic and human analysis increases the effort necessary to achieve similar effects substantially. Where automatic visualization only needs to map the data, in visual analytics the whole data preparation and processing pipeline has to be considered. The user is interested in representations reflecting certain interpretations of the data, for example the idea that different groups represent different clusters in the data. In this paper, we prove that an information-driven automatic design of visual analytics pipelines is feasible. To this end, we prove that the ability of an analysis system to derive and visualize data supporting inquired information is decidable – at least for real-world applications. Having overcome this major obstacle, we outline a general algorithm scheme that can be implemented on a wide range of data and information models.



* [DVQA: Understanding Data Visualizations via Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.08163.pdf); Kushal Kafle, Brian Price, Scott Cohen, Christopher Kanan; Bar charts are an effective way to convey numeric information, but today’s algorithms cannot parse them. Existing methods fail when faced with even minor variations in appearance. Here, we present DVQA, a dataset that tests many aspects of bar chart understanding in a question answering framework. Unlike visual question answering (VQA), DVQA requires processing words and answers that are unique to a particular bar chart.
